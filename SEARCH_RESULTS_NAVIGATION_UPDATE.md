# Search Results Navigation Update

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Previously, when users filled out a search form and were redirected to login due to authentication requirements, after successful login they would be redirected back to the home page where they would need to fill out the search form again manually.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Updated the `restoreSearchForm` method in `src/utils/userActionRestorer.js` to navigate directly to the search results page (`/search-results`) instead of the home page (`/`).

## 🔄 New Flow

### Before Update:
```
User fills search form → Auth required → Login → Redirected to home page → User needs to manually search again
```

### After Update:
```
User fills search form → Auth required → Login → Redirected directly to search results page → Automatic search with saved form data → Results displayed
```

## 📝 Technical Changes

### Modified File: `src/utils/userActionRestorer.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
navigate('/', {
  state: {
    fromLogin: true,
    restoreSearch: true,
    searchParams: formData,
    searchFormData: formData
  }
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
navigate('/search-results', {
  state: {
    fromLogin: true,
    searchParams: formData,
    searchResults: [], // Empty results - will be populated by automatic search
    restoreSearch: true
  }
});
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Users go directly to search results without manual intervention
2. **Automatic Search Execution**: The SearchResultsPage automatically performs the search with saved form data
3. **No Data Loss**: All search parameters are preserved and used for automatic search
4. **Consistent Flow**: Users experience the same flow as if they were never interrupted by authentication

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Search Form Tracking**: When user fills search form, all form data is tracked in localStorage
2. **Authentication Redirect**: When authentication is required, user is redirected to login
3. **Restoration**: After successful login, `restoreSearchForm` is called
4. **Direct Navigation**: System navigates directly to `/search-results` with search parameters
5. **Automatic Search**: SearchResultsPage detects `fromLogin: true` and automatically performs search
6. **Results Display**: Search results are displayed without any manual user action

## 🎨 User Experience

Users now experience:
- Uninterrupted search flow
- Automatic search execution after login
- Direct navigation to search results
- No need to re-enter search criteria
- Seamless continuation of their booking journey

This update significantly improves the user experience by eliminating the need for users to manually re-submit their search after authentication.
